                    <p className='about-me-p'>I have been engaged with computers since 2011 when my dad brought home a PC. Gaming ignited my curiosity about hardware and software, deepening my technical understanding. In 2018, during 11th grade, I discovered programming, starting with Java. Entering college, I shifted to web development, broadening my skills.

                    <h5 className='about-me-h5'>Present</h5>
                    <p className='about-me-p'>I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Applications while actively honing my programming skills. I have a strong preference for backend development over frontend and enjoy working on server-side logic and architecture. Now, I am seeking a developer position where I can apply my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growing as a software developer.

                    <p className='about-me-p'>In the future, I aim to strengthen my backend development skills by working on scalable and efficient systems. I have recently started solving problems on LeetCode to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. My goal is to secure a developer role where I can contribute to innovative projects, stay updated with emerging technologies, and continuously grow in my field.
